# UnReaL
A URL shortener practice project using ASP.NET Core MVC

Technology Audition - URL Shortener
===================================

The Problem:
============
Context:
- Imagine that it's the Summer of 2006. Twitter launched just a few months ago, and "tweeting" has become all the rage.
- You share a lot of URLs of cool blogs you've read and links to funny cat pictures.
- But long URLs leave little room for anything else in your tweets, and often you go over the 140 character limit.

The Solution:
- Architect and build the world's first URL shortening service
- You have a weekend (48 hours) to complete it
